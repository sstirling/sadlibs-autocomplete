# sadlibs-autocomplete
A tool that utilizes [Erin Petenko's autocomplete JQuery tool](https://github.com/epetenko/contact-nj-leg/), to populate a madlibs-style text and graphic section based on the geographic selection. The tool is called sadlibs because it was initially implemented for a story about [death.](http://death.nj.com) 

Here's a working example: [N.J. Medical Examiner Data](http://death.nj.com/data)

Basic notes:
- As of 12/18/17 The code is still a mess. I'm hoping to clean it up by the New Year.
